# The Simulator Bible

*smoll project by a smoll developer*

--------------------------

## What is this?

The Bible simulator is a development by GelatinAndWater, it is a small project that aims to replicate simulators currently available but in greater detail and with more dynamic abilities. 

## What does/will have?

Currently the Bible simulator is in pre-alpha development / testing for The Hunger Games simulator, yet in the future it will have many more simulators. And example of a planned future project would be a big brother simulator.

## How do I play it?

All instructions are within the simulator, however there will be more within the Github page and the Itch.io page.

## Anything else?
